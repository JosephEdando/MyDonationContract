The Donation smart contract enables transparent fundraising on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The contract uses the PriceConverter library to ensure donations meet a minimum USD value of $50, 
making it accessible yet impactful for charitable campaigns.

Key Features:

•	USD Conversion: Leverages real-time Ether-to-USD conversion for accurate donation tracking.

•	Event Logging: Emits events for all donations and withdrawals for auditability.

•	Owner Control: Ensures that only the contract owner can withdraw funds securely.

Challenges Faced and Resolutions

Challenge 1: Integrating Price Conversion

Incorporating real-time Ether-to-USD conversion required a solid understanding of the PriceConverter library and its interaction with Chainlink oracles.

Resolution:

•	Referred to the documentation for Chainlink oracles.

•	Implemented a utility library to encapsulate conversion logic, ensuring code modularity and reusability.

Challenge 2: Setting a Minimum Donation Threshold

Ensuring donations met a minimum USD equivalent without rejecting valid contributions was critical.

Resolution:

•	Used msg.value.getConversionRate() to calculate the Ether-to-USD value dynamically.

•	Applied a constant MINIMUM_USD value for easy modification and clarity.

Challenge 3: Secure Withdrawals

Facilitating secure fund withdrawals without compromising on transparency or user trust posed a unique challenge.

Resolution:

•	Added an onlyOwner modifier to restrict the withdrawal function.

•	Used Solidity’s call method to transfer funds, ensuring proper handling of Ether.

Challenge 4: Event Logging for Transparency

To enhance trust, the contract needed to log all critical operations (e.g., donations and withdrawals).

Resolution:

•	Implemented DonationReceived and FundsWithdrawn events.

•	Ensured events were emitted on every successful donation and withdrawal.

Insights Gained

1. Modular Design
The use of the PriceConverter library highlighted the importance of separating utility functions for better readability and maintainability.
